# mtl-art
An andoid app that invites you to discover and photograph Montreal's public art.

Through this app, we'd like to offer a new and fun way to interact with the public art collection of the city of Montreal.
**Features**: artwork of the day, list and map view of all artworks, details about each work, list of favorites, photograph the work to add it to your personnal gallery.

This is our first project and it is a big work in progress. We look forward to all suggestions and comments but please be kind, we are doing the best we can!
